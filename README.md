## sfntshape

A simple `Shape` type to render vectorial shapes through [golang.org/x/image/vector#Rasterizer](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/image/vector#Rasterizer).

This code was originally part of [etxt](https://github.com/tinne26/etxt), but I decided to move it out for v0.0.9. The code now doesn't depend on [etxt](https://github.com/tinne26/etxt) nor [Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org).

Check out a cool [online example](https://tinne26.github.com/sfntshape), or run it yourself with:
```
go run github.com/tinne26/sfntshape/examples/rng@latest
```
